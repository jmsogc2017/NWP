### Coursera Data Science Capstone Final Course Project


This application, the Next Word Predictor or NWP, was developed for the Coursera Data Science Capstone course final project.

The goal of this project is to build a predictive text model combined with a shiny app UI that will predict the next word as a user types a sentence similar to the way most smart phone keyboards are implemented today using the technology of Swiftkey.
